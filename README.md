# TSP-ResourceCalculator V1.0  
This resource calculator is aimed for easier off world resouce management.  
Game version: 1.1.263  

You may input any intergers in the higher tier resource boxes, and the calculator will return equivalent result. 
example:\
**input**:\
*1*  Basic Material\
**output**:\
*3* Steel Ingots|
*1* Titanium Ingots|
*15* Iron|
*3* Carbon|
*5* Titanium|
*5* Silicate

This means, you will need everything on the bottom row to make 1 Basic Material.  
BUT, if you already have 3 Steel Ingots, you may ignore the amount of base resource needed for those 3 ingots.  
Therefore you will only need 5 Silicate AND 5 titanium ore OR 1 Titanium ingots

For a second calculation, you MUST click the reset button first, or the output value will have remanent of previous result added on.  

*Disclaimer, I am very new to coding in the version as of writing this document. There will be bugs, and there are missing features.  
Please contact me in Discord if you have suggestions and/or problems  
Have fun!
